        <p>
          Hello JS warrior! Are you ready for your JavaScripting Adventure? 🚀
        </p>
        <p>
          A group of programming languages broke into your files and are trying to damage your code
          by inserting their own, turning it into pure giberish!! We can't let that happen! 😱
        </p>
        <p>
          Your objective is to dodge incoming programming languages in order to keep your code
          integrity for as long as possible. 🏆
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also shoot <span class="bullet-number">5</span> error 404's to get the other
          languages out of your way! Be on the lookout for incoming JS libraries and frameworks as
          they give you more ammo.
          <br />
          Are you ready? Let's go! 🤖
