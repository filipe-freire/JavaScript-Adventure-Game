### The game's Info:

Hello JS warrior! Are you ready for your JavaScripting Adventure? A group of programming languages broke into your files and are trying to damage your code by inserting their own, turning it into pure giberish!! We can't let that happen! Your objective is to dodge incoming programming languages in order to keep your code integrity for as long as possible.
You can also shoot 5 error 404's to get the other languages out of your way!
